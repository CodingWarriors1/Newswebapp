Due to video  restriction duration and time constraint we were not able to tell that we have 
also done the seo (search engine optimization) of the website so it will rank better during search results and some minor features.

List of the features that we will modify and make the existing feature more versatile.

1)	QR code â€“ Implemented in the website but will make it more versatile.
2)	Web Scrapping- Implemented the web scrapping just need to make more dynamic and versatile.
3)	To make front end UI more better.
4)	To automate some of the task using django-crontab library as this is only for linux deployment 
    not for windows and due to time constraint we were not able to build it so we will add it.
5)	We will also integrate RASA chatbot into the website so that to improve the user experience.
